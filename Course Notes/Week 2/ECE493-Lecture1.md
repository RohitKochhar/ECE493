## Motivation

- Wireless networks, in general, provide the backbone for ubiquitous information access and resource sharing.
- Advancements in sensor technology and wireless networks has spawned the emergence of IoT.
- The data collected through a network gets fused, aggregated, routed and transported to control, analysed and transported to other devices.
- IoT is still an emerging field that is poised to change our lives.
- By 2025, more than 50 billion devices will be connected and communicating through the internet.
- While the world of IoT is still emrging, there is still a need for inexpensive, fast, low-power and intelligent devices.

## IoT and Sensor Networks

- IoT refers to embedding sensors, computing and connectivity in our everyday devices, opening the door to an unprecedented level of automation and personalization. However, without a scalable way to track and analyze all of the data being produced, these benefits cannot be fully realized. 
- IoT and Sensor networks are an enabled for a broad range of applications in different sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, mining, smart cities and more.
